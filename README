# Automatic configuration for local Git repository from a project fork
#
# Rationale:
# This method of forking helps minimise conflicts by encouraging pristine
# tracking of upstream master and edge branches. It also promotes organised 
# branching and encourages the frequent upstream assimilation of pull
# requests. It does this by allowing easy tracking of the upstream master and
# edge branches and providing a local development branch to submit pull
# requests to upstream via GitHub's forking system which provides a nice
# interface for managing pull requests.
#
# This script will create a local clone of the forked project Git repository
# located on GitHub. The specified project fork will be added as an additional
# remote repository and a new development branch created to track local
# development.
#
# Requirements:
# 1. working git installation
# 2. project fork repository on GitHub
# 
# Usage:
# localforkedcone.sh <YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME> <FORKED_PROJECT_NAME> <UPSTREAM_GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME> [YOUR_DEV_BRANCH=dev] [BRANCH_TO_TRACK=edge]
